					<p> In the recent release of Disney’s animated film Coco, the main character’s best friend is played by no other than a stereotypical friendly dog. Dante, the protagonist’s dog, fits into the cultural trope of dogs in film — but can we blame Disney? Everyone loves dogs. It’s expected that the loyal sidekick role would be played by a dog given its already achieved popularity, and maybe that’s just the problem. </p>

					<p>When it comes to Disney movies, an animal is never just an animal. Every animated character in Disney’s animal kingdom is divided into one of two categories: The Good Guys and The Bad Guys. </p>

					<p> Cute and harmless animals, from dogs and rabbits to mice and elephants, are almost always cast as the protagonists and affable sidekick. And when Disney has a protagonist, they must always balance it with an antagonist — these designated villains often take the form of sharks, snakes, crocodiles, predatory birds, and weasels. </p>

					<p> The Walt Disney Animation Studios gained its popularity from creating adored characters like Dumbo, Bambi, and Lady and the Tramp. Disney’s target audience is children, and children are well known to use the information given to them to make assumptions about the world around them. Since much of cultural understanding is drawn from media, companies such as Disney play an influential role in how children (and adults) determine the value of ideas, objects, and animals. </p>

					<blockquote> “Humans tend to place more value on vertebrates that are cute & fluffy or large and interesting,” said Michael Donaldson, a research specialist and biology professor at Carleton University. “Creepy/crawly species tend to receive less attention and may even be considered “less important” even though they can have very important biological and ecological functions that support large charismatic species.”</blockquote>

					<p> If every single movie tells a child that all snakes are villainous and all rabbits are helpful friends, it would be likely that a child would deflect those personalities onto every snake and rabbit they saw. </p>

					<p> This is exactly why in the weeks after the 2003 release of Finding Nemo, clownfishes became the leader of aquarium sales. Every little kid wanted a to own their own Nemo. However, people did not take into account that 90% of clown fish sold are taken from the wild. Because of this, many areas where clownfish lived experienced a local extinction and pushed an already threatened species to the brink. </p>

					<p> Time and time again, Disney has proven that they have a complicated relationship with any animal that seems unhuggable. Disney’s latest film featuring the dog Dante will add onto to the already long list of protagonist dogs featured in Disney’s animated movies. In an analysis of 35 Disney movies, 37% of those movies featured dogs as their leading roles. Out of 37% of the dogs, all but two played the protagonists in the given film. In the same 35 Disney movies, 20% of those movies featured cats. Contrastingly, every cat besides one played an antagonist role, and that’s not even counting the characters in the big cat family. </p>

					<p> Compiled data from 35 of Disney’s most popular animated movies featuring animals shows how certain species are only given villainous roles and are never depicted as heroes. Similarly, some animal species are always granted the role of the protagonist or lovable friend. Animals including crocodiles, sharks, vultures, and snakes did not play a single heroic role in the course of the 35 Disney movies analyzed. This differs from animals like bunnies, elephants, and deer, who always play a protagonist role. </p>

					<img class="responsive-img" class= "img2" src= "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*JmGQ2faeGs1AL1ShI8EgOQ.jpeg">

					<p> Disney not only restricts these animal species to protagonist or antagonist roles, but they also change their animation styles depending on the species they are illustrating. For example, notice how all of the animals who consistently play antagonist roles are pictured with conniving smirks, a devious persona, and darker shades. This contrasts with the animals who consistently play protagonist roles who are all pictured with a welcoming, loving smile, and typically brighter colors. </p>

					<blockquote> “[People] remember movies most vividly when they do have predators as antagonists and more lovable animals as victims. Conventional roles stick with the viewer better,” said Henry Bernstein, an animator at Pixeldust Studios. “If you have predatory animal like a crocodile or a snake, it is much more believable that they are the villain because that is their role in real life.” </blockquote>

					<p> While we might want to give Disney the benefit of the doubt and suggest they don’t create and perpetuate negative stereotypes about certain animals purposely, make no mistake — this is done deliberately. An interesting case for this is Kaa in the movie The Jungle Book, a sneaky snake who has the power of hypnotizing his victims before devouring them alive. However, while he tried to prey on the child in the movie, the original book version describes Kaa as the child’s protector and helpful companion. </p>

					<p> The idea of a friendly snake doesn’t fit into the cultural trope about slithery malevolent snakes, so it’s likely that Disney changed the nature of Kaa to fit the evil narrative snakes have been innately dealt. </p>

					<p> “Presumed animal behaviors and attitudes have historically been mapped to animal species resulting in established stereotypes,” said Dawnja Burris, a media researcher and producer who focuses her research in animal representation in media. “Such stereotypes limit understanding of certain animals and relegate conception of these animals to small and contrived sets.” </p>

					<p> With Disney and other mega media brands designating these species as the dangerous adversaries that prey on the cute protagonists, it comes as no surprise that people grow up irrationally afraid of these animals. </p>

					<p> Let’s take sharks for example. Sharks can be seen as the main antagonists in nearly any Disney animation film that takes place underwater. From Bruce in Finding Nemo to Glut the Shark in the Little Mermaid, sharks are depicted as the sharp-toothed predators that commonly haunt the dreams of any beachgoer. Disney is guilty of making sharks look like they lurk in the shallow shores waiting to take a bite out of the first person they see. </p>

					<p> However, statistically speaking, you have a 1 in 3,748,067 chance of dying in a shark attack, according to the International Shark Attack File of the University of Florida’s Museum of Natural History. According to an analysis of CDC data from LCB, only one person per year is killed by a shark in the United States. To put these numbers into perspective, an estimated of 120 people are killed annually by deer and 28 people are killed by dogs. </p>

					<img class="responsive-img" class= "img3" src= "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*9dOKS8FAzv89wI6JCi1Y2Q.jpeg">

					<p> While shark attack fatalities remain low for humans, fatalities for sharks are egregiously high — an estimated amount of 100 million sharks are killed by humans every year. Despite this, sharks seem to receive limited conservation advocacy in comparison to other animals. </p>

					<p> While it is well known that our beloved elephants are endangered, many people might not know that great white sharks are even more endangered. There is only an estimated amount of 3,500 of these big bad boy sharks left in the wild. Comparatively, there is an estimated amount of 450,000–700,000 African elephants and between 35,000–40,000 Asian elephants in the wild today. </p>

					<blockquote> “Charismatic megafauna tends to be what people care about, hence they get funding and attention. For example, it is no random occurrence that the Panda is the symbol of WWF,” said Sam Edwards, the director of animal conservation and care at Green Mountain College. “”Protect our elephants” is more likely to get support than protect our yellow jackets, jelly fish, sea urchins, etc.” </blockquote>

					<p> This is likely the reason why sharks continuously receive less conservation efforts and research programs in comparison to endangered mammals, such as elephants. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums is a non-profit organization dedicated to creating and tracking international programs for animal welfare, conservation efforts, and scientific education. Since 2010, they have consistently reported a rise in programs for African and Asian elephants. In comparison, programs for sharks are seeing a rise in recent years but still remain consistently low. </p>

					<p> Attention given to animals within conservation and media are interlinked. Media companies, such as Disney, help inform our biases for or against certain animals. Consequently, these biases help us decide which animals to feature in ad campaigns and promote conservation for. </p>

					<p> It is likely that you have seen WWF commercials about ending ivory trade with elephants and ASPCA commercials about saving puppies. And while these commercials are incredibly important, it is also important to note that you’ve probably never seen a commercial about stopping shark finning. </p>

					<p> While animal symbolism and perceptions may vary between cultures, a string of some type of animal stereotype can be found as the common thread in nearly every culture. This isn’t to say that you should jump into a school of wild sharks or second guess your dog loving nature, but rather just reconsider which animals you classify as good and which animals you write off as bad. While some of these stereotypes may even be based in a grain in truth, it’s important to think about how media creates and reinforces assumptions of our furry, scaly, and feathered friends. </p>

					<blockquote> “Animal species that are not apex predators and therefore pose little to no threat to humans are the ones always chosen as featured protagonist characters,” said Dawnja Burris. “In the case of protection of wildlife and animals, the systematic lack of inclusion and recognition of the “uncharismatic” animal types accounts for the perpetuation of their exploitation.” </blockquote>
